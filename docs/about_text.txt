It is a semestral project for the Python using tkinter and modules already available.

The main goal of this game is to destroy all marbles in the playground. When three or more marbles
of the same color are connected, they are destroyed. For n destroyed marbles, you get n^2 points.
When there is a single marble disconnected from any other, it gets destroyed and you get 1 point.
The game ends when you either destroy all marbles, or a marble touches the bottom edge.

Good luck!
